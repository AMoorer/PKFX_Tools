<h1>MakeSomeNoise v1.1.2 is Here! 🎉</h1>

<p>Hey everyone! I'm excited to share that <strong>MakeSomeNoise v1.1.2</strong> just dropped, and this one's packed with some really cool updates.</p>

<h2>What's MakeSomeNoise?</h2>

<p>If you're not familiar, MakeSomeNoise is a free tool I built for generating procedural noise textures. Think Perlin noise, Simplex, FBM—all that good stuff that makes your game worlds, VFX, and 3D art look way more interesting. It's a standalone Windows app, so no Python installation or command-line wizardry required. Just download and run.</p>

<h2>What's New in v1.1.2?</h2>

<h3>Built-in Learning Guide 📚</h3>

<p>This was a big one for me. I added a complete <strong>"Guide To Noise"</strong> right in the app. Click the help button and you get detailed explanations for every noise algorithm—the history, how it works, when to use it, and pro tips. I wanted to make this tool educational, not just functional. Whether you're learning about noise for the first time or just need a quick refresher on what "octaves" actually do, it's all there.</p>

<h3>Export Previews &amp; Animation Playback 🎬</h3>

<p>You can now preview your exports before committing! Want to see what that 16-frame atlas will look like? Preview it. Need to check your animation sequence? Play it back at any FPS from 1-60. There's also a handy right-click menu for copying the preview to clipboard or jumping straight to your export folder.</p>

<h3>Smarter File Management 📂</h3>

<p>The app now automatically manages file versions for you (_v00, _v01, etc.), so you'll never accidentally overwrite that perfect noise pattern you made. Export paths are also fully visible now—no more mystery directories.</p>

<h3>Cleaner, Smoother Experience ✨</h3>

<p>I've been squashing bugs and polishing the UI. Better tooltips everywhere, improved thread management (no more crashes when you spam those sliders), and generally just a more responsive app. Oh, and I removed the redundant "3D Slice" noise type since you can already do that with offset animations.</p>

<h2>The Licensing Thing</h2>

<p>Quick note: The <strong>app itself</strong> is free to use for anything, including commercial projects. You just can't sell the app or bundle it for profit without asking me first. But here's the cool part—<strong>anything you generate with it</strong> (textures, images, animations) is completely yours under CC0. Use them commercially, sell them, make NFTs, whatever. No attribution needed (though it's always appreciated 😊).</p>

<h2>Download It!</h2>

<p>Ready to generate some noise? Head over to the <strong><a href="https://github.com/AMoorer/PKFX_Tools/releases/tag/v1.1.2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Release Page</a></strong> and grab the executable. It's a single 120MB file—download, double-click, and you're good to go.</p>

<p>First run might take a few seconds while Windows Defender does its thing, but after that it's smooth sailing.</p>

<h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>

<p>For the nerds (and future me who forgets this stuff), this release also includes a complete repository restructure to industry-standard layout. Everything's organized properly now: <code>src/</code>, <code>docs/</code>, <code>scripts/</code>, <code>tests/</code>. I even wrote a code review document because I'm apparently that kind of person now.</p>

<h2>What's Next?</h2>

<p>I've got a <a href="https://github.com/AMoorer/PKFX_Tools/blob/main/docs/ROADMAP.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roadmap</a> brewing with some exciting stuff for v1.2.0—more noise types (Voronoi/Worley, curl noise, billowed), procedural shapes with SDFs, alpha channel support, and maybe even normal map generation. If you've got ideas or feature requests, hit me up on GitHub!</p>

<h2>Try It Out!</h2>

<p>If you're doing any kind of procedural generation work—game dev, VFX, generative art, whatever—give MakeSomeNoise a spin. It's free, it's fast, and now it comes with its own tutorial built in.</p>

<p><strong>Download</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/AMoorer/PKFX_Tools/releases/tag/v1.1.2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MakeSomeNoise v1.1.2 on GitHub</a></p>

<p>Happy noise-making! 🎨</p>
