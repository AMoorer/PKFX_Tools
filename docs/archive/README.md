# Archive Folder

This folder contains legacy configuration files that were part of the broader PKFX_Tools vision but are not needed for MakeSomeNoise v1.1.2.

## Archived Files

### `requirements_extended.txt`
- **Purpose**: Extended Python libraries for tech art & game development
- **Contents**: Audio processing, GPU computing, game engines, Jupyter, documentation tools
- **Reason for Archive**: MakeSomeNoise only needs minimal dependencies (PySide6, NumPy, Pillow, noise libraries)
- **Date Archived**: October 24, 2025

### `EXTENSIONS_EXTENDED.md`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive VS Code extensions for game development, VR/XR, and tech art
- **Contents**: Unity/Unreal tools, 3D viewers, shader development, remote development, AI tools
- **Reason for Archive**: Consolidated into main EXTENSIONS_GUIDE.md with MakeSomeNoise-specific recommendations
- **Date Archived**: October 24, 2025

### `examples/`
- **Purpose**: Example Python scripts demonstrating noise generation API usage
- **Contents**: noise_examples.py, noise_3d_example.py, README_NOISE.md, sample outputs
- **Reason for Archive**: Examples were for programmatic API use, not relevant for GUI-based MakeSomeNoise
- **Date Archived**: October 24, 2025
- **Note**: May be useful for future Python API development

## For Future Reference

These files are preserved for potential future PKFX_Tools projects that may require:
- VR/XR development capabilities
- 3D mesh processing and physics simulation
- Game engine integration
- Advanced visualization and profiling tools
- GPU-accelerated computing

If you're expanding PKFX_Tools beyond MakeSomeNoise, these files may be useful starting points.
