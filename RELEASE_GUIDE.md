# Creating a GitHub Release for MakeSomeNoise

This guide explains how to create a GitHub Release and upload the executable for easy distribution.

## Why Use GitHub Releases?

- ‚úÖ Proper way to distribute binary executables
- ‚úÖ Doesn't bloat the git repository
- ‚úÖ Users get direct download links
- ‚úÖ Automatic version tracking
- ‚úÖ Release notes for changelog

## Step-by-Step Release Process

### 1. Ensure Everything is Committed

```powershell
git status  # Should show "working tree clean"
```

### 2. Build the Executable

   - The file will be uploaded and appear in the assets list

8. **Set as latest release**: Check "Set as the latest release"

9. **Publish release**: Click **"Publish release"**

#### Option B: Via GitHub CLI (Advanced)

```powershell
# Install GitHub CLI if not already installed
# https://cli.github.com/

# Login
gh auth login

# Create release with executable
gh release create v1.0.0 `
    dist\MakeSomeNoise.exe `
    --title "MakeSomeNoise v1.0.0" `

```

### 5. Verify the Release

## Release Checklist

Before publishing a release:

- [ ] All code is committed and pushed
- [ ] Executable builds without errors
- [ ] Executable has been tested and works
- [ ] Version number is updated (if applicable)
- [ ] Release notes are prepared
- [ ] Tag follows semantic versioning (v1.0.0, v1.1.0, etc.)
- [ ] Changelog mentions all new features/fixes

## Version Numbering (Semantic Versioning)

- **v1.0.0** - Initial release
- **v1.0.1** - Bug fixes only
- **v1.1.0** - New features, backward compatible
- **v2.0.0** - Breaking changes

## Future Releases

For subsequent releases:

1. Make your code changes
2. Commit and push
3. Rebuild executable: `.\build_executable.ps1`
4. Create new release with incremented version
5. Add changelog describing what changed

Example changelog format:
```markdown
## What's Changed
- Added new noise type: Voronoi
- Fixed seam artifacts at high blend widths
- Improved export performance by 30%
- Updated UI with new color scheme

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed crash when exporting at 4096√ó4096
- Fixed memory leak in animation export
```

## Editing/Deleting Releases

- **Edit**: Click the pencil icon on the release
- **Delete**: Click "Delete this release" at the bottom
- **Delete tag**: `git push --delete origin v1.0.0`

## Tips

1. **Draft releases first**: Use "Save draft" to prepare release notes before publishing
2. **Pre-releases**: Check "This is a pre-release" for beta versions
3. **Multiple files**: Upload additional files (documentation, source code zip, etc.)
4. **Automatic notes**: GitHub can auto-generate release notes from commits
5. **Security**: Scan executable with antivirus before uploading

## Common Issues

**Release not showing up:**
- Refresh the page
- Check you selected the correct repository
- Ensure you clicked "Publish release" not "Save draft"

**Can't upload executable (too large):**
- GitHub allows up to 2GB per file
- Your executable (~116MB) is well within limits

**Download statistics:**
- View download counts in the release's "Assets" section
- Helps track adoption
